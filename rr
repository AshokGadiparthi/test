It seems that you're trying to import a function `get_executor` from `src.ml_engine.kedro_runner` in your `pipelines.py`, but it doesn't exist in the file, which is causing the `ImportError`.

### Issue:

* The `ImportError` is saying that Python cannot find the `get_executor` function in the `kedro_runner.py` file in `src/ml_engine/`.

### Solution:

* It seems that you may have missed defining the `get_executor` function in `kedro_runner.py` or possibly misreferenced it.
* If the intention is to expose the `KedroExecutor` class or any function like `get_executor` for pipeline execution, I’ll guide you on how to proceed.

### Option 1: Expose the `KedroExecutor` class as `get_executor` in `kedro_runner.py`

In `src/ml_engine/kedro_runner.py`, add a `get_executor` function that returns an instance of `KedroExecutor`. This way, you can import `get_executor` in `pipelines.py`.

**Updated `kedro_runner.py`:**

```python
# src/ml_engine/kedro_runner.py

from .kedro_executor import KedroExecutor

def get_executor(project_path: str = None) -> KedroExecutor:
    """
    Returns an instance of the KedroExecutor.

    Args:
        project_path: Path to Kedro project root (optional)

    Returns:
        KedroExecutor: Instance of the executor
    """
    return KedroExecutor(project_path=project_path)

# Your other code here...
```

Now, you can import `get_executor` in your `pipelines.py`:

**Updated `pipelines.py`**:

```python
# app/api/pipelines.py

from src.ml_engine.kedro_runner import get_executor

# Now you can use get_executor to get an instance of KedroExecutor
```

---

### Option 2: Directly Instantiate `KedroExecutor` in `pipelines.py`

Alternatively, if you don't need the `get_executor` function and just need to instantiate `KedroExecutor` directly in `pipelines.py`, you can do so:

```python
# app/api/pipelines.py

from src.ml_engine.kedro_executor import KedroExecutor

# Directly use KedroExecutor instead of get_executor
executor = KedroExecutor(project_path='/home/ashok/work/latest/full/kedro-engine-dynamic')
```

### Next Steps:

1. **Option 1**: If you want to keep the `get_executor` function, make sure you add the `get_executor` function to `kedro_runner.py` as shown above.
2. **Option 2**: If you just need the `KedroExecutor` in `pipelines.py`, directly import and instantiate the `KedroExecutor` class.

Once you've updated the code, try running your application again. This should resolve the `ImportError` issue. Let me know if you need further assistance!
