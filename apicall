1. Spanner change streams bundle multiple row changes from a single transaction into one DataChangeRecord, resulting in ~4M initial elements representing transactions, not individual rows.
2. Each DataChangeRecord contains a list of Mod objects, averaging ~4.5 Mods per record in this workload, where each Mod details a specific row insert, update, or delete.
3. The "To OrderMutations" transform uses a DoFn that loops over all Mods, outputting one OrderMutation per Mod, causing a fan-out expansion to ~18M elements.
4. This increase reflects batched operations in Spanner (e.g., bulk inserts/updates), common for efficiency and atomicity in high-volume apps like order processing.
5. The design ensures row-level syncing to BigQuery; to mitigate high counts, optimize transactions for fewer rows or bundle outputs in the DoFn.
