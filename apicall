Today we successfully gave a demo to LP and team showcasing the queries and results related to key fields such as email, name, EUP, and plan. The team is aligned and heading in the right direction with data validation.

This session helped the team gain a better understanding of how to write effective queries, where to check for data validation, and how to approach different use cases. We’ve also set up a shared document to consistently track prepared queries and maintain daily results for comparison across dates.

For some upstream use cases, data is currently not flowing due to Cassandra GoldenGate maintenance activities. Once the data is available, we’ll continue validation for the remaining use cases like EUP, Add-a-line, and New Customer flows.
