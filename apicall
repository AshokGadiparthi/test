We have two Dataflow jobs (“Job2” and “Job3”) that copy data from Spanner to BigQuery.  
• Job3 in particular is incurring unexpectedly high costs—processing volumes have not changed, but spend is up by ~X%.  
• We need guidance on pipeline tuning (worker type, autoscaling settings, fusion breakpoints, batch vs. streaming) to minimize cost.  
• We’re also seeing intermittent “AccessDeniedException: Permission denied” errors when the pipeline tries to load its JAR from GCS; it appears to be a bucket IAM/ACL issue but only affects some executions.  

Please help us:  
1. Identify why costs have spiked and recommend configuration/architecture optimizations.  
2. Diagnose and resolve the intermittent GCS permission failures (our service account roles include Storage Object Viewer).  

We can share logs, job IDs, and billing snapshots as needed.
