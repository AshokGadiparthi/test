Step-by-Step Business Logic
Step 1: Validate Spanner Data Presence and Freshness
Goal: Ensure the Spanner table is receiving real-time EUP records where changes occurred (eup_chng_ts IS NOT NULL).

Business Justification:
If eup_chng_ts is null or missing, the transformation might not be triggering or dataflow jobs could be dropping incomplete data.

Step 2: Field-Level Match Between BigQuery and Spanner
Keys to Join:

cust_id + mtn form a unique identifier for a customer's mobile line and upgrade event.

Fields to Compare:

prod_nm (product name)

eqp_device_id (equipment/device ID)

Optionally: eup_chng_ts (standardized to DATE(eup_chng_ts))

Business Justification:
The customer should see the same device and product information regardless of whether it's from batch (Teradata) or real-time (Cassandra/Spanner). Any mismatch indicates:

Transformation issues in Dataflow

Mapping differences between source systems

Schema misalignment

Step 3: Fallback to Raw Cassandra ‚Üí BQ Tables
Scenario:
If a record exists in BigQuery (Teradata) but not in Spanner, it may have been dropped or not processed in the pipeline.

Logic:

Check if the raw message for that cust_id + mtn is present in the raw ingestion tables.

If present: Data ingestion worked but transformation or Dataflow mapping may have skipped it.

Business Justification:
This helps isolate if the issue is in the ingestion (GoldenGate or Kafka) or transformation stage (Dataflow). It's part of root cause analysis.

Step 4: Lookback Logic for Fulfillment Delay
Scenario:
If the record is missing in both Spanner and raw messages, fulfillment might be delayed.

Logic:

Query Spanner for the same cust_id + mtn for the past 7 days.

Some customers may place EUP orders, but backend processing takes days due to manual review, inventory issues, or system delays.

Business Justification:
This logic reflects real-world delay scenarios. Validations need to be intelligent enough to recognize expected delays and avoid false alarms.

üìä Why This Validation Is Important
Ensures end-to-end trust in the data between batch and real-time systems.

Identifies pipeline failures, transformation bugs, or source system issues.

Supports regulatory compliance and auditing by proving data lineage and consistency.

Helps business teams track EUP performance, customer experience, and fulfillment accuracy.

üß† Optional Enhancements
Add a validation status column (MATCHED, MISMATCH, MISSING_IN_SPANNER, ONLY_IN_RAW, DELAYED) with automated tagging.

Schedule this as a daily job with Slack/Email alerts for mismatches.

Store all results in a validation audit table for historical tracking.

Reasoned about self-service data validation system for 9 seconds
Below is an outline for a world-class, highly optimized, self-service data validation framework‚Äîwith UI access and dashboards‚Äîthat you can leverage across 10+ use cases.

Key Components and Architecture
Data Validation Engine:

Great Expectations:
A popular open-source framework that lets you write data expectations as code. It supports parameterized tests and assertions for a variety of data sources. With Great Expectations, you can define reusable ‚Äúexpectations‚Äù for each use case, ensuring consistency across validations.

DBT (Data Build Tool):
You can embed data quality tests directly in your transformation code. DBT allows you to write SQL-based tests that can be maintained in version control, ensuring that your pipelines are always validated against the defined business rules.

Orchestration and Automation:

Apache Airflow or Prefect:
Use an orchestration tool to schedule and manage your data validation jobs across multiple use cases. Airflow‚Äôs DAGs can trigger both data ingestion pipelines and validation jobs, while providing logging and status monitoring in an easy-to-use UI.

Self-Service UI and Dashboarding:

BI Tools (e.g., Looker, Tableau, or Apache Superset/Metabase):
A robust BI platform can visualize validation metrics over time. Users can drill down into validation failures, compare historical trends, and monitor system health. The dashboard should display key metrics such as match rates, error counts, and alert statuses.

Custom Web Portal:
For a tailored self-service experience, you could build a lightweight web application that integrates with your validation engine‚Äôs API. This portal would offer real-time results, interactive querying capabilities, and the ability to trigger validations on demand.

Centralized Data Catalog and Metadata Management:

Data Catalog Integration (e.g., Collibra, Amundsen):
Linking your validation framework with a data catalog helps data stewards and engineers easily navigate source-to-target lineage. This integration can enrich validation dashboards with metadata such as table relationships and schema versions.

Alerting and Reporting:

Automated Alerts:
Integrate notifications through Slack, Email, or other messaging platforms. Set threshold-based alerts (for instance, when a validation count deviates significantly) so the team can quickly respond to issues.

Summary Reporting:
Generate daily or weekly summary reports that show overall validation health, making it easier for stakeholders to track data quality across multiple use cases.
