Thank you for taking the time to meet with us today and for your valuable insights regarding the high operational cost of our Dataflow Job3.

Based on our discussion, we have noted the following key recommendations and next steps:

Machine Type Optimization:
We will downscale the current machine type to a smaller configuration (e.g., 2 vCPU with 8 GB RAM) to assess cost reduction impact while maintaining job performance.

Flex Template & SDK Upgrade:
As we're currently deploying via a custom Flex Template using the Google Artifact Registry, we acknowledge the importance of upgrading to the latest SDK version and will prioritize this as part of our next deployment cycle.

Spanner to BigQuery Template:
We appreciate the suggestion to explore the new native template provided by Google for Spanner to BigQuery migration. We will conduct a POC in our lower environments to verify compatibility with key data types like DATETIME, and assess its suitability for our production workloads.

Backlog Snapshot for Review:
Renga will share 4 to 5 relevant screenshots with Yogesh for further analysis of backlog processing and performance patterns.

We sincerely thank the Google technical team for their guidance and continued support. These recommendations are timely and highly relevant as we work towards improving both efficiency and cost-effectiveness in our pipeline operations.
