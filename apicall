We are experiencing an issue with our Dataflow job related to Spanner change streams in our development environment. The Dataflow job ID is [insert failed Dataflow job ID here].

Issue Details:

Each time we launch the Dataflow job, a new metadata table is created in Spanner.
In the previous successful runs, the metadata tables contain rows with partition information as expected.
However, for the current job, the newly created metadata table is empty, which is causing the change stream processing to fail.
We believe this issue is related to the Spanner metadata table that gets created by the Dataflow job.
Steps Taken:

We have verified that the job is correctly configured and have compared it with previous successful jobs.
We've noticed that the issue seems to stem from the metadata table not being populated as it should be.
Request: We require assistance from the Google Spanner-Dataflow engineering team to investigate and resolve this issue. We would like to understand why the metadata table is not being populated and what steps we can take to ensure that the change streams are processed correctly.

Please let us know if additional information or logs are required to assist with troubleshooting.
