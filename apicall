Thank you for your confirmation. We’ll have a detailed discussion during tomorrow morning’s call to finalize the approach for adding the timestamp columns to the solution.

In the meantime, I wanted to share some observations from our latest bulk testing with 1000 records using the current deployment in the development environment (with 1 worker):

Insert: Less than 5 seconds
Update: Around 7 to 8 seconds
Delete: Less than 3 seconds
We tested with the following metrics:

Insertion: 100 records
Update: 800 records
Deletion: 500 records
Everything is working as expected so far. We’ll discuss more during the call tomorrow.

Thanks again for your support, and I look forward to our discussion!
