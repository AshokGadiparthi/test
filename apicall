Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

We have implemented two of the suggested solutions for handling BigQuery DML operations, but we are still encountering rate limit exceptions. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the approaches we have tried and our current implementation:

Option 1: BigQuery Job for Merging Every 5 Minutes

We have implemented this solution but found it inadequate due to the requirement for real-time updates. This batch-based approach does not meet our needs.
Option 2: BigQuery CDC to Merge Using Two Dataflow Jobs

We have set up one Dataflow job to write logs to a Pub/Sub topic and another job to read from Pub/Sub and perform DML operations (insert, delete, update). Despite this, we are still experiencing rate limit exceptions.
Current Implementation:

We have created a custom Dataflow function BatchDmlFn as shown below, which is intended to batch DML operations and execute them concurrently. However, we are still facing rate limit issues.

    private static final int MAX_CONCURRENT_DML = 2;
    private static final int BATCH_SIZE = 20;

    private transient BigQuery bigquery;
    private List<String> batch = new ArrayList<>();

    @Setup
    public void setup() {
        bigquery = BigQueryOptions.getDefaultInstance().getService();
    }

    @ProcessElement
    public void processElement(ProcessContext c) {
        batch.add(c.element());

        if (batch.size() >= BATCH_SIZE) {
            executeBatch(new ArrayList<>(batch));
            batch.clear();
        }
    }

    @FinishBundle
    public void finishBundle(FinishBundleContext c) {
        if (!batch.isEmpty()) {
            executeBatch(new ArrayList<>(batch));
            batch.clear();
        }
    }

    private void executeBatch(List<String> queries) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(MAX_CONCURRENT_DML);
        List<Callable<Void>> tasks = new ArrayList<>();

        for (List<String> subBatch : partition(queries, BATCH_SIZE)) {
            tasks.add(() -> {
                try {
                    for (String dmlQuery : subBatch) {
                        JobId jobId = JobId.of("your_job_id");
                        QueryJobConfiguration queryConfig = QueryJobConfiguration.newBuilder(dmlQuery).build();
                        Job job = bigquery.create(JobInfo.newBuilder(queryConfig).setJobId(jobId).build());
                        job = job.waitFor(); // Wait for the job to complete
                        if (job.hasErrors()) {
                            // Handle errors
                        }
                    }
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                return null;
            });
        }

        try {
            List<Future<Void>> futures = executor.invokeAll(tasks);
            for (Future<Void> future : futures) {
                try {
                    future.get();
                } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            executor.shutdown();
        }
    }

    private <T> List<List<T>> partition(List<T> list, int size) {
        List<List<T>> partitions = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i += size) {
            partitions.add(list.subList(i, Math.min(i + size, list.size())));
        }
        return partitions;
    }
}
Key Points About the Current Implementation:

Concurrency Handling:

The implementation uses a fixed thread pool with MAX_CONCURRENT_DML set to 2, to limit the number of concurrent DML operations.
Batching Mechanism:

Batches of size BATCH_SIZE (20) are processed to group DML operations and reduce the number of BigQuery jobs.
Error Handling:

The implementation includes basic error handling for job creation and execution.
Rate Limit Exceptions:

Despite the batching and concurrency controls, we continue to face rate limit exceptions.
Further Assistance Required:

We are exploring a third option and would appreciate any existing templates or guidance on a more efficient approach to handle DML operations within BigQuery limits.
Please let us know if you can provide any additional support or if a working session could be arranged to discuss Option 3. We are keen to resolve this issue as promptly as possible.

Thank you for your assistance.
