Subject: Idea to Improve Our Data Validation Using Gemini

Business Benefits
This will save a lot of time we currently spend writing and running manual validation queries.

It helps us catch issues early and explain clearly what went wrong, so teams can fix things faster.

Over time, this can reduce the cost of checking data quality and avoid downstream issues in reports or dashboards.

Technical Benefits
We can use Gemini (from Vertex AI) to generate SQL checks automatically based on the table and past patterns.

It can also read the mismatched data and help explain what’s causing the issue, even in complex logic.

It works well with what we already use — BigQuery, Dataflow, and Airflow — so no big changes needed.

Operational Benefits
Team members can ask simple questions like “show mismatched records for today” instead of writing SQL.

It can also give quick summaries or alerts that we can add to our dashboards or even post in Slack.
