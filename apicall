Below is your clean, professional, manager-ready explanation of the entire ML scoring system based on the files you shared (Java MOJO code, Python external table scripts, BTEQ, Spark wrapper, 185+ models, AutoML flow).



This is written exactly the way you should speak to your manager, architect, or interviewer to show deep understanding.

✅ 
My Understanding of the Verizon H2O MOJO Scoring System (Clear & Professional)


Below is the best-possible structured explanation of what your team is doing, in simple, accurate architecture terms.

1. Overall Goal of the System


The objective of this platform is to:



✔ Train ML models in H2O AutoML

✔ Export models as MOJO artifacts

✔ Run predictions locally using Java MOJO executables

✔ Load predicted scores into Hive/Impala/Spark

✔ Create external tables and final datasets

✔ Push scoring results into Teradata



We do this for more than 185+ production scoring use cases (churn, upsell, cross-sell, usage patterns, sentiment, price sensitivity, fraud, retention, BDV, FiOS, wireless, etc.).

2. Model Training Process (H2O AutoML)


1️⃣ Data scientists prepare features using Python notebooks.

2️⃣ H2O AutoML trains models with constraints:

max_models

max_runtime_secs

3️⃣ For many use cases:

XGBoost / GBM / RandomForest dominate

Deep Learning is normally excluded for speed

4️⃣ H2O produces a MOJO.zip file for each trained model.

5️⃣ MOJO is checked into Git and deployed to the scoring servers.



➡ MOJO is the portable scoring artifact we use in Java.

3. Java MOJO Scoring Program (Your Java Files)


Each use case has a Java class:



aal_ge_mbb_predict_model_mojo.java

aal_smb_mbb_predict_model_mojo.java

vzc_rev_fs_score_mojo.java

win_upsell_score_mojo.java

…etc.



✔ Responsibilities of each Java file:


A. Load the MOJO model

GenModel genModel = MojoModel.load(modelName);
model = new EasyPredictModelWrapper(
    new EasyPredictModelWrapper.Config().setModel(genModel)
);
B. Parse command-line arguments

--mojo (path to MOJO ZIP)

--input (pipe-delimited input file)

--output (predicted score file)



C. Read input file

Handles pipe ‘|’ delimiter

Cleans data (NA, empty, or bad formats)

Converts date columns to epoch timestamps



D. Perform scoring

Depending on model type:

AutoEncoder  
Binomial  
Multinomial  
Clustering  
Regression
E. Write predictions to the output CSV file.



F. Shutdown + cleanup



This Java scoring component is extremely stable and scalable — no need for Python model loading or Spark model broadcast.

4. Python External Table Generators (*_score_ext_tbl.py)


Each model has a corresponding Python script:



Example:

aal_ge_mbb_score_ext_tbl.py

wls_5gbil_score_ext_tbl.py

vzc_high_risk_score_ext_tbl.py



✔ What these Python files do:
Start Spark session

Drop existing external tables if they exist

Create external table pointing to the MOJO prediction output

Load predictions into Hive/Impala

Produce a uniform table structure for downstream BTEQ or Teradata load



Example log messages:
“Successfully dropped external table…”

“Successfully created external view…”



This guarantees each model’s scores are structured in the same way for downstream loading.

5. Spark Integration


Spark is not used for scoring the ML model.

Spark is used only for:



✔ Creating external tables

✔ Reading prediction outputs

✔ Maintaining schema and data types

✔ Performing partition logic if needed



This keeps scoring light-weight and fast.

6. BTEQ Scripts


Each use case has a .bteq file.



Example:

aal_ge_mbb_clean_stg.bteq



These scripts:

✔ Create Teradata staging tables

✔ Load data from Hive external tables

✔ Validate row counts

✔ Apply data-type casting

✔ Prepare final tables for analytics or downstream consumption



This closes the final leg from Hadoop → Teradata.

7. Multi-Cluster Execution


Because scores need to be generated for 185+ models, you cannot run everything on one cluster.



You maintain:

✔ Multiple local H2O clusters

✔ Distributed workloads based on data size + use case

✔ Repurposed compute resources



Each cluster focuses on a specific group of models (SMB, MBB, PS, GE, REV, UPS, BDV, TIBR, churn, etc.)

8. Typical Prediction Flow (End-to-End)


Step 1 — Input File Prepared (Pipe Delimited)


input_data_file.txt



Step 2 — Java MOJO Execution
java -cp model.jar aal_ge_mbb_predict_model_mojo \
 --mojo ge_mbb_tree_model.zip \
 --input ge_input.txt \
 --output ge_prediction_out.txt
Step 3 — Create External Table (Python + Spark)


Python script reads ge_prediction_out.txt and creates

ext_tbl_ge_mbb_score



Step 4 — BTEQ Loads to Teradata


Final table:

TERADATA.GE_MBB_SCORE_OUT



Step 5 — Downstream Consumption


BI, dashboards, churn systems, marketing triggers, etc.

9. Understanding the 185+ Model Catalog


You shared the Sheets list — examples include:



✔ VBGWS_BM_SU — Upgrade likelihood

✔ VBGWPS_CHURN — Churn predictor

✔ VZC_GENERIC_UP — Connect propensity

✔ VZC_LOGBOK_UP — Logbook upsell

✔ VZC_HIGH_RISK_MDL — High-risk customer

✔ VBGM_UPSELL_FIOS — FiOS upsell

✔ VBGW_ACCT_5YRRLV — 5-year survivability

✔ VBGWM_LINE_2YRLTV — 2-year LTV



Each model has:

Business intent

Model ID

Output schema

Java MOJO class

Python ETL script

BTEQ staging script

10. Summary — My Clear Understanding


Here is the final summary you can tell your manager:

“Our ML platform runs 185+ H2O AutoML models using a clean pipeline: Java MOJO for scoring, Python+Spark for external table creation, and BTEQ for loading predictions into Teradata. Each model has a dedicated Java executable that loads the MOJO, cleans input columns, performs scoring, and writes an output CSV. A Python script then creates a standardized external view, and finally BTEQ loads the data into Teradata tables. The entire system is modular, scalable, repeatable, and optimized so scoring is done without Spark—keeping performance extremely high.”
If you’d like, I can also prepare:

✅ Your one-page architecture diagram

✅ Your manager-ready slide deck (8–10 slides)

✅ Your spoken explanation for meetings

✅ Your notepad bullet summary like your teammate



Just tell me which one you want next.
