Subject: Request to Include Timestamp Columns in Spanner to BigQuery CDC Solution for Validation

Dear [Google Support Team/Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

Thank you for the support and guidance youâ€™ve provided with the current Spanner to BigQuery CDC solution. The solution is working well, and we are continuing to validate the change propagation across our data pipeline.

As part of the validation process, I would like to propose an enhancement to the existing solution by introducing timestamp columns. Specifically, we would like to add a TIMESTAMP field to the Spanner table and a corresponding field in BigQuery. This will allow us to precisely measure and validate the time it takes for changes (insert, update, delete) in Spanner to reflect in BigQuery via the CDC pipeline.

Proposed Change:
Spanner Table:
Add a TIMESTAMP column (e.g., insert_time, update_time) to log the time of each operation.
BigQuery Table:
Mirror the same column in BigQuery to capture and compare the propagation delay.
Benefit:
By adding these columns, we can perform more detailed validations to confirm how long it takes for CDC changes to propagate from Spanner to BigQuery. This will help us ensure the solution meets real-time or near-real-time requirements and address any delays that may occur during dataflow processing.

Could you please review this proposal and suggest how we can integrate these timestamp columns into the existing solution? I believe this will greatly improve our ability to monitor the accuracy and performance of the data flow.

Looking forward to your thoughts and any further recommendations you may have.

Thank you once again for your support!
