Everything is working as expected so far. However, I’d like to note that last week, the entire solution was not working, and yesterday's deployment even took significant time for processing just 3 records. Fortunately, today's deployment has met our expectations, but we’ll need a few more fresh deployments to confirm consistent performance.
