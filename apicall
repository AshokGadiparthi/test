Step1: Get service account access for Teradata, BigQuery, Dataproc, Vertex AI
Step2: Access existing H2O/Spark ML production environment (Read-Only)
Step3: Inventory of all ML models, pipelines, datasets, features
Step4: Extract all Teradata table dependencies
Step5: Understand BigQuery data models and feature store mapping
Step6: Categorize ML models (BQML / Dataproc Spark ML / Vertex Python)
Step7: Map all feature engineering pipelines to BigQuery/Python
Step8: Migrate and modernize feature engineering (Spark → BQ/Dataflow)
Step9: Retrain models on Vertex AI / BigQuery ML / Dataproc
Step10: Validate model accuracy, performance, cost
Step11: Setup CI/CD via Jenkins or Cloud Build
Step12: Setup observability (Cloud Monitoring, Logging, BQ audit logs)
Step13: Deploy models (Batch via Composer, Real-Time via Vertex Endpoint)
Step14: Create cutover plan with parallel run and final switch
