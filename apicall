Slide 1 - Title Slide

"Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to everyone joining from across the world. I am truly honored to be here at the 7th International Conference on Communication and Computational Technologies (ICCCT 2025).
I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the organizers for this opportunity to share insights on a topic that is shaping modern cloud architectures—seamless data integration on Google Cloud."

My name is Ashok Gadi Parthi, and I work as a Senior Data Architect, specializing in real-time and batch data integration across cloud platforms. Over the years, I have helped leading telecom, banking, aerospace, and e-commerce organizations design scalable, high-performance data architectures.

Today, I will walk you through how to architect robust, scalable, and cost-efficient data workflows on Google Cloud using BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Dataflow, Spanner, and Redis.
Let’s explore how we can process data in real-time and batch, ensuring seamless integration across different systems."*
-------------------------------------------------
Slide 2 - The Data Explosion Challenge

We live in a data-driven world. Right now, as we speak, we are generating 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day.

Here’s something even more mind-blowing—90% of the world’s data has been created in just the last two years.

The challenge isn’t just collecting data—it’s about integrating and making sense of it in real-time. Businesses struggle to bring together batch and streaming data from disconnected systems and get actionable insights quickly.

-----------------------------------------
Slide 3 - The Key Challenges

Before we jump into solutions, let’s talk about the key problems organizations face with data integration:"

✅ Data Silos → Data is scattered across multiple platforms, making integration complex.
✅ Scalability Issues → Handling massive datasets with real-time requirements.
✅ Latency vs. Cost → Companies want insights fast but also need to optimize costs.
✅ Data Governance → Ensuring security, consistency, and compliance across systems.

"Solving these challenges requires a scalable, real-time, and cost-efficient data integration strategy—which brings us to Google Cloud."

-------------------------------------

Slide 4 - Google Cloud as the Solution
*"Google Cloud provides a seamless data integration framework with services that handle batch and real-time data at scale.

Key services include:"*
✔ Cloud Storage (GCS) → Centralized ingestion of batch data.
✔ BigQuery → Serverless data warehouse for analytics.
✔ Pub/Sub → Real-time event-driven messaging.
✔ Dataflow → Scalable data processing with Apache Beam.
✔ Spanner → Globally distributed transactional database.
✔ Redis → Low-latency caching for real-time lookups.

"With these building blocks, we can design efficient, real-time and batch data pipelines."

---------------------------

Slide 5 - The Core Building Blocks of Data Integration
"Data processing falls into two major categories:
✅ Batch Processing → Periodic ETL with Cloud Storage & BigQuery.
✅ Streaming Processing → Continuous data ingestion via Pub/Sub & Dataflow."

------------------------

Slide 6 - Batch Processing Pipeline Architecture
*"Let’s take a practical example—daily transaction processing.

How does this work?"*

1. Step 1: Data lands in Cloud Storage as raw files.
2. Step 2: Dataflow transforms and cleanses the data.
3. Step 3: Data is loaded into BigQuery for reporting & analytics.

✅ Optimization Techniques:
✔ Use partitioning & clustering in BigQuery for faster queries.
✔ Use columnar storage compression to reduce costs.
-------------------------------------------------

Slide 7 - Real-Time Streaming Pipeline Architecture
"Now, let’s compare this with a real-time streaming use case. Imagine processing user events from a mobile app in real-time."

1️. Step 1: Events are ingested via Pub/Sub.
2. Step 2: Dataflow (Apache Beam) processes data streams.
3. Step 3: Data is stored in BigQuery for real-time dashboards.

✅ Optimization Techniques:
✔ Use windowing & watermarks in Dataflow to handle late-arriving data.
✔ Use DLP API for real-time data security & PII masking.

-----------------------------------

Slide 8 - Case Study: Change Data Capture (CDC)
*"Let’s look at a real-world use case: Syncing operational and analytical databases in real-time.

The challenge? Keeping Google Spanner (OLTP system) and BigQuery (analytics warehouse) in sync."*

✅ Solution: Implement Change Data Capture (CDC)

📌 Flow:
1. Spanner Change Streams detect data changes.
2. Pub/Sub sends updates.
3. Dataflow processes & transforms data.
4. BigQuery stores the final analytics dataset.

-----------------

Slide 9 - Best Practices for CDC on GCP
✅ Use exactly-once processing in Dataflow.
✅ Optimize for cost by batching BigQuery Streaming Inserts.
✅ Use Cloud Logging & Metrics Explorer for monitoring.

"With these best practices, we ensure real-time, fault-tolerant, and cost-effective CDC pipelines."

------------------

Slide 10 - Best Practices for Scalable Data Integration
✔ Design for Failures → Implement retries & idempotency.
✔ Use Schema Evolution → Adapt to changing datasets.
✔ Balance Batch & Streaming → Optimize processing costs.
✔ Use Dataplex for Governance → Metadata & security management.

--------------------

Slide 11 - The Future of Data Integration
🚀 AI-Powered Data Integration → ML-driven ETL optimizations.
🌍 Multi-Cloud Data Architectures → BigQuery Omni for federated queries.
🔒 Enhanced Security & Compliance → IAM, VPC-SC, encryption.

"The future is about intelligent, automated, and seamless integration!"

-----------------

Slide 12 - Conclusion
✅ Data integration is the foundation of modern cloud architectures.
✅ Google Cloud provides the best tools for seamless, real-time data processing.
✅ With BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Dataflow, and Spanner, we can build highly scalable data pipelines.

🎤 Final Thought:
"The future of data integration is seamless, intelligent, and scalable. Let’s build the next generation of real-time analytics together!"

🎤 Closing:
"Thank you! I’m happy to take any questions."
