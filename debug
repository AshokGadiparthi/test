You are asking: “What is this file and why is it used?”

Based on all the screenshots, the file you are showing (ZDWA1SEG.txt) is NOT a model file, NOT Java, NOT Spark code.



It is a job orchestration script used in Verizon’s ESPX production system.



Let me explain clearly.

✅ 
What This File Is


This file (ZDWA1SEG.txt) is a batch job orchestration definition used for:



✔ Scheduling


✔ Running


✔ Sequencing


✔ Automating


✔ Monitoring


the entire ML scoring pipeline for one or more models.



It is basically the “CONTROL FILE” or “MASTER JOB FLOW” for the end-to-end ML scoring process.

✅ 
Why This File Is Used


This orchestration file is used to automate the complete monthly scoring pipeline:



1. Extract Input Data
Runs Spark jobs

Creates input files for model scoring

Sets date variables, month boundaries, report dates



2. Execute Model Scoring (Java MOJO)
Calls the Java scorer for each model

Generates score files

Handles errors + status codes



3. Manage HDFS Locations
Creates directories

Copies scored files to HDFS

Removes old files

Organizes data by month / model / report date



4. Create External Hive Tables
Triggers Spark-submit jobs

Runs *_score_ext_tbl.py to create external tables



5. Clean Staging Tables
Runs BTEQ scripts to drop/create Teradata staging tables



6. Load Scores into Teradata
Runs BTEQ scripts to load data from Hive to Teradata

Validates record counts

Ensures final analytic tables are created correctly



7. Send Email Notifications
Sends “Model Run Complete” emails

Notifies distros on success/failure

Adds logs



8. Error Handling & Recovery
Each block is atomic (LINUX_JOB)

Failures send alerts

Pipeline stops in a controlled manner

⭐ 
In Simple Words


This script is:



The master controller that runs the entire ML pipeline — from input extraction to scoring to Teradata load — automatically, without manual work.


It makes sure all steps run in the correct order:

Prepare →

Score →

Load →

Notify



for every model.

⭐ 
If This File Did NOT Exist


Your team would have to run:

Spark jobs manually

Python scripts manually

Java scorers manually

HDFS copies manually

BTEQ loads manually

Email notifications manually



Which is impossible for 185+ models.



This file ensures zero manual intervention, consistency, reliability, and monthly automation.

⭐ 
One-Line Answer


This is an enterprise batch orchestration file used to automatically run, manage, and monitor the entire ML scoring pipeline for multiple models in production.

If you want, I can also give you:

✔ A simple 5-line explanation to tell your manager

✔ A diagram showing how this job orchestrates everything

✔ A voice-style explanation you can speak in meetings



Just tell me.
